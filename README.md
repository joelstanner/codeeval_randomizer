To use this script, go to https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/ and save
the html file there to 'codeeval_open_challenges.html' (you must be logged in).
Now, in the same directory that you saved that HTML file, run this script with
a number corresponding to which level of eval you are looking to attempt. For
example `python random_challenge2.py 1`. This will return a random challenge
from the "easy" category. The valid choices are as follows:

* 1 - easy
* 2 - moderate
* 3 - hard
* 4 - any

This script will skip any challenges that you have already completed.
